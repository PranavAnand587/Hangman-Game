storyText = '''You open your eyes and realize that you are not in the safety of your house. Your hands are tied, and you 
cannot move.You look around you , hoping to find some way to escape. There are no windows, just a single 
lightbulb hanging above you in the darkroom and a chalkboard in front of you.The rest of the room was pitch black.
Suddenly, you hear the footsteps approaching you. You can't see anything more than a man with a 
white mask standing in front of the chalkboard. The man in the mask takes out a pistol and points it at you. 

The Masked Man said : "Here's what's going to happen...we're going to play a game of hangman. If you don't follow the rules, 
then I will shoot you on the spot.
Now, to start the game, I will need you to put your head through that rope you see in front of you," 

"Good. Now here's how the game works; I have a nice game of hangman on this chalkboard you see here. 
Now obviously you've played hangman before, but this time it has more stakes, which makes it all the 
more fun! You are going to have to guess the letters of a word here.

If you get a letter or letters correct, I will add it to the word. However, if you guess a letter 
incorrectly, then I will add a body part to the stick figure. Six incorrect guesses later I'll draw 
an entire stick figure and then you will be hung. If you win, I will free you. Do you understand the 
rules?"'''

Pulling the slide of the gun he said : "Perfect, Let's begin!" '''

desperately for air, as the rope swung back and forth. You start to limp and eventually stop moving. '''
